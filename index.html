        <h2>Popup Message</h2>
        <p>Hey, I’ve read what you said, and I just want to clear things up because you deserve to know the truth. First off, I haven’t moved on. Not even close. I know I’m talking to someone right now, but it’s not romantic, and to be honest, it’s not going well. My mind and heart are still with you.<br><br>
        When we broke up, I thought you had already moved on, that you had found someone new. It was like I had to accept that I lost you, so I ended up talking to someone else. But deep down, I never really got over you. I just didn’t know what else to do. And now I realize that I acted on something that wasn’t even real because you didn’t actually have a new guy.<br><br>
        The truth is, I still care about you a lot. I still think about what we had, and I know I made mistakes along the way. But if there’s a chance for us to talk things out and fix this, I’m open to that because I haven’t let go of what we had.<br><br>
        I hope you understand why I acted the way I did, even though I know it hurt both of us. But I want you to know that you still mean a lot to me, and if there’s any way we can figure things out, I'd like to try.     -Vincent
